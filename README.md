# OS
This branch is the stable one.
Use make in "all" directory to make it.
Then, use "qemu-system-x86_64 testOs.flp" to test it.
NB : All these command work well on ubuntu 20.04. It should work under other linux distribution, but not under windows and macos.
If you want to make it, but you are under windows or macos, install ubuntu 20.04 or install it on a virtual machine (recommand = virtualbox)
